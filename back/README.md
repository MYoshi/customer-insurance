# Project base

This project is created using [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
It uses a MySQL database and TYPEORM to generate the database data

## Available Scripts

To execute the project, just run:

### `npm start`

It is possible to run together with FRONT, because front contains a proxy on the package.json file.

## Improvements

- The Database is a total sketch, it should have more options
- Only one controller is used, a big one on the app to save everything one by one since it is the only execution
